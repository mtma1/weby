    Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, 
    longer than sentences, but shorter than sections, chapters, or entire works. 
    Because they connect the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, 
    paragraph structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and comprehension. 

    Students have a lot of questions when it comes to 
    writing a paragraph: How many sentences should you use? How do you transition
    within a paragraph? When do you end a paragraph? Etc.
    Below we explain everything you need to know about paragraph structure to write like an expert, 
    including several paragraph examples.
